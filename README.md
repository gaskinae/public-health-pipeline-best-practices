# Public Health Pipeline Best Practices

In an attempt to assist software developers, the Bioinformatics Pipelines and Visualization Working Group of the Public Health Alliance for Genomic Epidemiology (PHA4GE) has proposed a set of best practices, tailored specifically for public health bioinformatics pipelines. These best practices aim to provide a guidance framework for development, testing, maintenance of bioinformatics software. By adhering closely to these best practices, developers can enhance the quality, reliability and sustainability of their software, facilitating impact in public health research.
